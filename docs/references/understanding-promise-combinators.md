# Understanding PromiseCombinators

Dealing with an aysnchronous event emitter means we have to deal with resolving Promises as a critical component of the 
library. We expose the ability to tightly control how the Promises associated with your event listeners are handled 
through the use of the `PromiseCombinator` enum.

> Labrador Kennel's usage of an enum is defined by the [cspray/yape](http://yape.cspray.io) library which provides code 
> generation tools to create type-safe enums in PHP.

If you have not already done so we highly recommend taking a look over [Amp's Promise Combinators documentation](https://amphp.org/amp/promises/combinators)
as the `PromiseCombinator` enum is an encapsulation of this logic and functionality.

By default all Promises generated by event listeners are resolved using the `Amp\Promise\all` strategy. If you desire 
different Promise resolution when emitting events you can pass a `PromiseCombinator` as the second argument to 
`EventEmitter::emit()`. With this you're able to have complete, flexible control over how event resolution is handled 
within your application.
